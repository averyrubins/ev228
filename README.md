# ev228
analysis of environmental data - individual

To run the code, I needed to download all files in the Practical 4 Data folder and copy and paste each individual title of the .csv files into the code. The file path was /Users/averyrubins/data/ev228_data/Practical4_Data/, and the function was fun_import_data(file_path, file_name, column_index, row_index). I kept column and row values the same for each run, and nothing changed about the function except for the different .csv files. I ended up running all 7 .csv files in different functions at the same time.
